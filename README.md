SimpleQuine
===========

A Simple Quine in Python. 

 - quine.py: This is the completed python quine file
 - prog.txt: This is the "core" portion of quine.py that will parse the array and print either the number or cast it as a character and print that.
 - mkarray.py: This file reads in prog.txt and generates the array for quine.py.

This quine has three parts:

 1. Data Array
 2. Print the Data Array
 3. Print the Data Array cast as Characters

Important to note that 3 results in the code required to perform 2 & 3.  1 is created with the helper file mkarray.py.
